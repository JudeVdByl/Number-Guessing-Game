# Number Guessing Game ðŸŽ¯

This is a simple Python-based number guessing game that challenges users to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. Players can choose between two difficulty levels: easy (10 guesses) and hard (5 guesses).

## Features

- Choose your difficulty: Easy or Hard
- Get feedback on whether your guess is too high or too low
- Replay as many times as you like
- Clean and simple command-line interface

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Run the script from the command line:

```bash
python guessing_game.py


> Note: The script assumes you have an `art` module or `art.logo` available. If not, you can either comment out the logo line or provide your own ASCII logo.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Optional: `art` module for displaying ASCII art (can be replaced or removed)

## License
